## About

Visit at [Rent Internet](https://rent-internet.com/)

Website developed with NextJS for [OnPrint Media](https://onprintmedia.ch/), using Static Export in order to keep their traditional hosting that doesn't support Nodejs and be able to use the NextJS benefits. Uses Wordpress (with Woocommerce) as a Headless CMS and Firebase Cloud Functions to execute functions outside the client, mostly to integrate Stripe as a payment gateway.

Both design (Figma) and development by Diego Iovane.
